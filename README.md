Created snake game using the structured programming

- The player starts with 3 health which is equal to the total of segments of the player
- There are 3 collectible:
  ~ Green: increases score by 10, slightly increases the speed, and give the player an extra health + segment. It respawns immediately after being eaten
  ~ Magenta: increases the score by 100, slightly increases the speed, and give the player an extra health + segment. It takes 15 seconds to spawn and
             remains on the screen for only 5 seconds. (So make sure to take it as a way to increase your score faster)
  ~ Cyan: it decreases the speed of the player by half and the effect is only for 8 seconds. It also gives the player an extra health + segment
- Working on rendering the remaining 3 moving obstacles
