Created snake game using the structured programming

  - The player starts with 3 health which is equal to the total of segments of the player
  - There are 3 collectible: ~ Green: increases score by 10, slightly increases the speed, and give the player an extra health + segment. It respawns immediately after being eaten ~ Magenta: increases the score by 100, slightly increases the speed, and give the player an extra health + segment. It takes 15 seconds to spawn and remains on the screen for only 5 seconds. (So make sure to take it as a way to increase your score faster) ~ Cyan: it decreases the speed of the player by half and the effect is only for 8 seconds. It also gives the player an extra health + segment
  - There are 3 moving obstacles: ~ two of which are just for destraction, the first on appears after getting the score of 300, and the second one appears after score 500. ~ The third obstacle deducts 3 health from the player and also 3 segments, giving him the opportunity to move after 2 seconds
